274. H-Index

Difficulty: Medium

Description: 
Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

 

Example 1:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
Example 2:

Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

n == citations.length
1 <= n <= 5000
0 <= citations[i] <= 1000

Algorithm Explanation:
Implement a simple sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort) to sort the citations array in non-decreasing order.
Iterate through the sorted array in reverse to find the maximum h-index.
Update the h-index if the current citation count is greater than or equal to the number of papers.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(n^2) for the sorting step, where n is the length of the citations array. The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as no additional data structures are used except for a few variables.
