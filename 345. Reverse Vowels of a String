/*
345. Reverse Vowels of a String
Description: 
Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both cases.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "hello"
Output: "holle"


Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: "leotcede"

Language used: C#
Time complexity: O(n)
??Space complexity: O(10)~O(1) 
Algo: create an array of char and save all characters in s 
create a hash set and save all possible English vowels ( both upper and lower case~ aeiouAEIOU) 
inititialize two pointers: start = 0  & end= s.Length-1 
as long as start< end( as long as they have not cross yet): 
  - check if the hash set contians the char at index start, if it doesn't increase start by 1
  - check if the hash set contains the char at index end, if it doesn't, decrease end by 1
  - else( we have encounter a vowel at both start and end indexes)so,  we do the swap
