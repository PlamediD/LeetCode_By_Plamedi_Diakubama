/*Description: 
217. Contains Duplicate

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.


//Solution using C#
//First sort the array 
//then compare consecutive elements
//Sorting will help make it faster because if there are any duplicate integers, they will be consecutive after sorting.
//Time complexity:  O(n log n)
Sorting is O(n log n) and the sweeping is O(n)
The entire algorithm is dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n).
